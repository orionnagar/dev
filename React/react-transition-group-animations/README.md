# ⚛️ react-transition-group-animations

### Purpose
Demonstrate smooth **enter/exit animations** in React using **react-transition-group**.

### Concept
- `CSSTransition` adds CSS classes at each animation phase.  
- `TransitionGroup` manages mounting/unmounting multiple items.  
- CSS handles timing, easing, and transforms.

### Run
npm install  
npm run dev

### Teaching Notes
- Use `timeout` to match CSS transition duration.  
- Perfect for list inserts/removals, modals, and toasts.  
- For complex animations, pair with Framer Motion or GSAP.

### 📝 TODO
- [ ] Add slide and scale variants.  
- [ ] Demonstrate transition delays.  
- [ ] Combine multiple transitions with nested groups.  
- [ ] Replace CSS with keyframes API.

### Key Takeaway
`react-transition-group` gives granular control over lifecycle-tied animations with minimal overhead.
