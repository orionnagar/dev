⚛️ Project: react-ai-chat-interface
🎯 Goal

A minimal, beautiful, single-file React chat UI that mimics a conversation with an AI — no real backend yet, just a clear architecture with fake streaming responses.
It should:

Teach state updates, list rendering, forms, and async simulation

Be fully commented and readable as a teaching repo

Later connect to a real Node or Python LLM API when you’re ready
