# ⚛️ react-responsive-design-patterns

### Purpose
Demonstrate **responsive and adaptive design patterns** in React using CSS media queries and custom hooks.

### Concept
- Use CSS for layout changes (`@media` queries).  
- Use `useMediaQuery()` hook for conditional rendering in React.  
- Combine both for seamless adaptive behavior.

### Run
npm install  
npm run dev

### Teaching Notes
- Resize the browser to switch between Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop modes.  
- Hooks allow conditional logic (e.g., render fewer items on mobile).  
- Works great with responsive grid libraries or styled-components.

### 📝 TODO
- [ ] Add grid-based responsive layout (CSS Grid + media queries).  
- [ ] Integrate with theme switchers per breakpoint.  
- [ ] Combine with dynamic image sources for perf optimization.  
- [ ] Demonstrate server-side rendering fallback for window.matchMedia.

### Key Takeaway
Responsive design = CSS for visuals, React for behavior.
Both layers together ensure apps feel native on every device.
